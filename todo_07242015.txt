WAIT should I upload to maven central?
WAIT should I implement graph with generic nodes, or should I wrap a graph and node mapping in a neural net?

TODO gradelize graph project
- should probably add eclipse plugin
TODO update graph project, create branch and build, publish jar locally
TODO gradelize neurocity
TODO pull in graph project, use as base for neural net
